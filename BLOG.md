# Blog for Log My Run App - Prime Digital Academy Solo Project

## Monday, April 24, 2017

* 1:13 - started working on the app.  Putting together file structure.  Still need
to do grunt, install dependencies, fire up the server, and put together the README.

Installed grunt, dependencies, and got the JSON package updated
README file finished.  Tasks listed for the MVP.  Goal for today is to get as much of the MVP finished as possible.

First things first, time to spin up the Server.

Server spun up.  I was very fortunate to have that information already created in my sandbox.

Time to access the DB.  The DB that I will be working with is on MLab.

App now connects to the DB.  I also set up the GET, POST, and Delete routes on the server side.

I think all the back end stuff for right now is finished.  Time to tackle the MVP on the front end.

Set up the DOM to insert a run and send it as an object.  At this point it's only logging in a console.log, but it's a start.
One thing that needs to be done is set up the POST route now.  Also need to source the DB factory in the RunService Factory.

3:08 and MVP finished

2 hours into the project and I've already completed the MVP, which is awesome.  I need to take everything from the MVP and put it
into it's own view and compartmentalize things a little bit before moving on, then take a quick break to reset before taking on the login view.
